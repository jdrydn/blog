Working closely with [Matt House](https://matthewhou.se) and [Matt Weeks](https://matt.weeks.codes) in my final year of University, we built a web-platform for our dissertation to help new third-year students looking for groups & final-year-projects. I focused on the backend service, writing the entire stack in PHP (better the devil you know), building my own framework as I went along, and I'm pleased to say the entire project is open-sourced on Github 😎
