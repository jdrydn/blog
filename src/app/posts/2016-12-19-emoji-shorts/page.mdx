# Emoji Shorts

Sometimes, when you work with emojis 😎😍🤖🌎✊ they can be a real pain in the ass. One physical symbol can equal up to four Unicode characters, so when counting strings & encoding emojis into a valid format for your favourite legacy database, these fun little icons can physically make you 😡

But then you look at Slack, and that handles emoji with style…

I love how Slack handles emoji. Transforming `:tada:` into 🎉 and `:sunglasses:` into 😎 and so on. So, the engineer within me decided to find [a NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=emoji) to do this for me.

And after several hours, the closest I could find was [Mojier](https://npm.im/mojier), published two years ago, which mapped emojis to their shortcodes and back again. But being two years out of date means the library was half-complete, and the lookups were slow (`for(var p in emoji)`), so ten minutes later I had *emoji-shorts* online ✊

<WebLinkPreviewBlock
  href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/emoji-shorts"
  title="emoji-shorts"
  description="From 🌎 to :globe: and back again."
  variant="red"
  icon={getSocialLinkIcon('NPM')}/>

Using this to translate strings containing emoji is easy:

```jsx
var emoji = require('emoji-shorts');
console.log(emoji.toPlain('These violent delights have violent ends 😈'));
// These violent delights have violent ends :smiling_imp:
console.log(emoji.toRich('The most elegant parts of me weren\'t written by you :thinking:'));
// The most elegant parts of me weren't written by you 🤔
```

The emojis & relevant short-codes came [from Github themselves](https://github.com/github/gemoji), with a little post-processing to make the lookups a little faster. Ideally this would be used when saving user-input & when fetching user-input, so your ORM / database engine of choice is none the wiser 😉

If you have any questions, or you wish to submit a PR (of which all are welcome, we all ❤️ emojis!) then please feel free to get involved:

  variant="gray"
  icon={getSocialLinkIcon('GITHUB')}/>

In the meantime, Merry Christmas 🎄🎁🎅
