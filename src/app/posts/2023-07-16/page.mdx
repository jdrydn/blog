Ah DHH, your opinion pieces never cease to make waves! 🤣

This really should be a wider-focussed piece about how the internet comes and goes - everything online is ephemeral (even if you run your own servers (and promise to support really old software “*forever*”)) - but instead it's targeted at Google & their quick subset of Google Domains, probably helps “the DHH agenda” & “big corporate-led cloud providers are bad” narrative.

To be clear: This specific situation isn't great. If my domain registrar was selling my data (and more importantly, **my domains**!) without giving me enough time to migrate, I'd be angry too.

But this could happen with any service. Facebook, Gmail, iCloud or Yahoo Mail (that last one, perhaps should have happened already 😬). At any time in the future, a product/service will be deprecated & customers will have to pick up & take their business elsewhere.

Until then, enjoy today & be wary of those clickbait headlines!
